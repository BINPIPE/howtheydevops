> A curated collection of publicly available resources on how software companies around the world practice DevOps

## Introduction

__How They DevOps__ is a curated knowledge repository on DevOps related topics - CI/CD

There are many ways to practice DevOps. Fortunately, many companies are willing to share how they do it. I believe there is much to learn from this documented use cases and published resources. The list you'll find in this repository is a list of such resources.

You'll find reosurces indexed by companies, technologies and areas.

Happy Learning!
